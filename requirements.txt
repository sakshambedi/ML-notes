# WARNING: Using Anaconda instead of pip is highly recommended, especially on
# Windows or when using a GPU. Please see the installation instructions in
# INSTALL.md


##### Core scientific packages
jupyter
matplotlib
numpy
pandas
scipy
pydantic
keras

##### Machine Learning packages
scikit-learn

#### Graphing libs
graphviz 
pydotplus

# Installing Pytorch instead
torch
torchvision
torchsummary

# Optional: the XGBoost library is only used in chapter 7
#xgboost~=1.4.2
#
# Optional: the transformers library is only using in chapter 16
# transformers~=4.11.3

##### TensorFlow-related packages

# If you have a TF-compatible GPU and you want to enable GPU support, then
# replace tensorflow-serving-api with tensorflow-serving-api-gpu.
# Your GPU must have CUDA Compute Capability 3.5 or higher support, and
# you must install CUDA, cuDNN and more: see tensorflow.org for the detailed
# installation instructions.
# tensorflow

# Optional: the TF Serving API library is just needed for chapter 19.
# tensorflow-serving-api # or tensorflow-serving-api-gpu if gpu
# tensorflow-serving-api-gpu

# tensorboard
# tensorboard-plugin-profile
# tensorflow-datasets
# tensorflow-hub
# tensorflow-probability

# Optional: only used in chapter 13.
#tfx

# Optional: only used in chapter 16.
#tensorflow-addons~=0.14.0

##### Reinforcement Learning library (chapter 18)

# There are a few dependencies you need to install first, check out:
# https://github.com/openai/gym#installing-everything
# gym[Box2D,atari,accept-rom-license]

# WARNING: on Windows, installing Box2D this way requires:
# * Swig: http://www.swig.org/download.html
# * Microsoft C++ Build Tools: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/
# It's much easier to use Anaconda instead.
# tf-agents

##### Image manipulation
Pillow
graphviz
opencv-python
pyglet

#pyvirtualdisplay # needed in chapter 18, if on a headless server
                  # (i.e., without screen, e.g., Colab or VM)


##### Additional utilities

# Efficient jobs (caching, parallelism, persistence)
joblib

# Easy http requests
requests

# Nice utility to diff Jupyter Notebooks.
nbdime

# May be useful with Pandas for complex "where" clauses (e.g., Pandas
# tutorial).
numexpr

# Optional: these libraries can be useful in the chapter 3, exercise 4.
nltk~=3.6.5
urlextract~=1.4.0

# Optional: these libraries are only used in chapter 16
ftfy

# Optional: tqdm displays nice progress bars, ipywidgets for tqdm's notebook support
tqdm~=4.62.3
ipywidgets~=7.6.5
